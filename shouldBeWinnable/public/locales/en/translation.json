    "what is matched": "Matched betting is betting technique used by individuals to profit from the free bets and incentives offered by bookmakers, as well as discrepancies in odds and returns. It is generally considered risk-free as it is based on the application of a mathematical equation rather than chance. The basic idea is to place bets on all outcomes of an event across multiple bookmakers so that, whatever the outcome, the bets will be offset by the winnings from the other bookmaker.",
    "matched bet example": "Certainly, suppose you have $100 dollars in free bets from BetMGM, and you want to use them to make a matched bet. You could place a $100 bet on the New York Giants to win a game at +100 odds (bet $100, win $100). If the Giants win, you would win $100, since stake is not returned with free bets. You could then place a $50 bet without bet credits on the Giant to lose at +100 odds on DraftKings. Now, if the Giants lose, you would win $50 and your $50 stake. Either way, you make a $50 profit.",
    "what do you offer": "We offer a matched betting tool that can help find the optimal bets to place across all major bookmakers and markets in North America. You can input the bet credits and bookmakers you have available, and our tool will help you find the optimal bets across those options. In addition, we also offer an arbitrage tool, which finds difference in odds among bookmakers, and tells you exactly how much to bet on each outcome to exploit those discrepancies to guarantee a profit. International support is coming soon!",

        "content": "Generally, most betting services offer first time sign up rewards or something similar, which is great for our purposes. The more books you sign up for, the better, since the more options our calculators have to choose from when searching for bets. You never know when a book may make a mistake in their odds, and you can take advantage of that!"
