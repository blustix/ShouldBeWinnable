# ShouldBeWinnable

Matched betting project 

Sports betting does not have to be gambling; using matched betting, there is a guaranteed way to always turn a profit.
The basic idea is to bet on both sides of a head to head bet, no matter what happens, your bet will always hit.
However, implementing this is not so simple, the winnings are always taxed by the bookmaker, so the winning must also beat this tax.

There are two main ideas:

1. Using free credits: 
Betting services often give away free credits. We can use the free credits on multiple different services to guarantee extract value from these.

2. Finding discrepencies in different matchbooks' odds:
Sometimes, different services may have different odds for the same event, and thus different payouts. We can find and use these discrepencies to make a profit.
